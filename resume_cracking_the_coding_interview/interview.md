### before the Interview

> Without a great resume, there's no interview. And without great experience, there's no great resume

For current students, this may mean the following:

- Take the Big Project Classes: Seek out the classes with big coding projects. This is a great way to get some­
what practical experience before you have any formal work experience. The more relevant the project is
to the real  world, the better.

- Get an Internship: Do everything you can to land an internship early in school. It will pave the way for
even better internships before you graduate. Many of the top tech companies have internship programs
designed especially for freshman and sophomores. You can also look at startups, which might be more flexible.

- Start Something: Build a project on your own time, participate in hackathons, or contribute to an open
source project. It doesn't matter too much what it is. The important thing is that you're coding. Not only
will this develop your technical skills and practical experience, your initiative will impress companies.

#### **Writing a Great Resume**

> Resume screeners look for the same things that interviewers do. They want to know that you're smart and that you can code That means you should prepare your resume to highlight those two things. Your love of tennis, traveling, or magic cards won't do much to show that.

Appropriate Resume Length:

In the US, it is strongly advised to keep a resume to one page if you have less than ten years of experience. More experienced candidates can often justify 1.5 - 2 pages otherwise

Employment History :

Your resume does not-and should not-include a full history of every role you've ever had. Include only the relevant positions-the ones that make you a more impressive candidate.

Projects:

So what should you build? Honestly, it doesn't matter that much. Some employers really like open source projects (it offers experience contributing to a large code base), while others prefer independent projects (it's easier to understand your personal contributions). You could build a mobile app, a web app, or almost anything. The most important thing is that you're building something

Programming Languages:

Listing everything you've ever worked with is dangerous. Many interviewers consider anything on your resume to be "fair game" as far as the interview. One alternative is to list most of the languages you've used, but add your experience level. This approach is shown below:

- Languages: Java (expert}, C ++ (proficient), JavaScript (prior experience).

Use whatever wording ("expert'; "fluent'; etc.) effectively communicates your skillset.

Some people list the number of years of experience they have with a particular language, but this can be really confusing. If you first learned Java 10 years ago, and have used it occasionally throughout that time, how many years of experience is this? For this reason, the number of years of experience is a poor metric for resumes. It's better to just describe what you mean in plain English.

Advice for Non-Native English Speakers and Internationals:

Some companies will throw out your resume just because of a typo. Additionally, for US positions, do not include age, marital status, or nationality. This sort of personal informa­tion is not appreciated by companies, as it creates a legal liability for them.

Beware of  (Potential) Stigma:

- Enterprise Languages: Certain languages have a stigma associated with them, and those are often the ones that are used for enterprise development.

- Being Too Language Focused: when  they  see  a candidate seems to  flaunt which specific versions  of  a language they know, recruiters will often bucket the candidate as "not our kind of person". **Note** *that this does not mean that you should necessarily take this "language flaunting" off your resume. You need to understand what that company values. Some companies do value this.*

- Certifications: This goes hand-in-hand with being too language focused. the companies that are biased against candidates with a very lengthy list of technologies tend to also be biased against certifications.This means that in some cases, you should actually remove this sort of experience from your resume.

- Knowing Only One or Two Languages: when they see a resume with only one language, is that you haven't experienced very many problems. They also often worry that candidates with only one or two languages will have trouble learning new technologies.

## chapter V

### Behavioral Question

What are your weaknesses?  A good answer conveys a real, legitimate weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it. For example: *"Sometimes, I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work."*

What questions should you ask the interviewer?

- Genuine Questions: *"What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does
project planning happen on the team?"* These questions will give you a good feel for what the day-to-day life is like at the company.

- Insightful Questions: *"I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?"* These questions demonstrate your knowledge or understanding of technology, require advance research about the company.

- Passion Questions: *"'Tm very interested in scalability, and I'd love to learn more about it. What opportunities are there at this company to learn about this?"*  They show that you're inter­ested in learning and will be a strong contributor to the company.

### Know Your Techincal Projects

- The project had challenging components (beyond just "learning a lot").

- You played a central role (ideally on the challenging components).

- You can talk at technical depth.

### Responding to Behavioral Questions

- Be Specific, Not Arrogant

- Limit Details

- Focus on Yourself, Not Your Team

- Give Structured Answers

- Think About What it Says

### So, tell me about yourself

- Structure

- Hobbies

- Sprinkle in Shows of Success
